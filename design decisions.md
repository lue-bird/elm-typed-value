# design decisions Q&A

## naming

  - `Typed` hints to either just `Tagged` or `Checked`
  - `Public` hints to "accessible by everyone"
  - `untag` hints to the broader, open value
  - `Internal`, `internal` hint to hidden aspects
  - `Tagged` hints to "values `Tagged` with different tags won't count as the same".
    Same idea as [joneshf/elm-tagged](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/joneshf/elm-tagged/latest/)
  - `Checked` hints to not every value is considered valid. It must be `checked`
